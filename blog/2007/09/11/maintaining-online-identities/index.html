<article class="post-content">
  <p>I stumbled across this neat site called <a href="http://www.clipperz.com/">Clipperz</a> a
few weeks back. On the surface, it's "<em>a free and anonymous online password
manager</em>". This was immediately interesting to me because I'd really like to
find a (secure!) web-based password manager.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>More and more lately, I've been
trying to find web apps that can replace the desktop applications I use on a
daily basis. It's just so incredibly convenient to have the portability to be
able to do everything you need from inside a web-browser, and more importantly
to have the persistent-state data stored on the server-side rather than on
each individual machine I use throughout the day. I'm already a huge fan of
webapps like <a href="http://del.icio.us/tduckles">del.icio.us</a> (<em>for tracking all my
bookmarks</em>) and <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a> (<em>for all my
RSS aggregation and reading needs</em>), and finding a web-based password manager
would be ideal. It really becomes a chore remembering what username or e-mail
address I registered with at various websites: Amazon, eBay, Newegg, Google,
Yahoo, credit cards, travel sites, online bill pay, banks, etc. (Oy!) It's
just a lot of identities to juggle. I've thought about using
<a href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> or something, but that's a desktop app and I'd
have to keep my database in-sync between work and home.</p>

<p>What really interested me about Clipperz is their claim at being a "zero-
knowledge" web-application: they only store encrypted data on their server-
side, and use Javascript to decrypt the data client-side based on the username
and password which you supply. Your password is never sent to the server at
all; it's merely used to decrypt the data locally. That's a pretty slick idea,
IMO. But, I'm also a little nervous about trusting some third-party website
will all my personal sensitive online account information. So, I'm tempted to
sit down and write my own webapp to recreate that wheel, except that it's all
code I can vouch for and know that it's not secretly sending my data off to
some third-party site. You can already find open-source Javascript-based
implementations of the various crypto algorithms that I'd need to use. And it
seems like a simple AJAX-based webapp to save/load data from the server.</p>

<p>Also really intriguing is Clipperz' one-click-sign-in feature. They have a
Javascript bookmark which pulls HTML FORM information off a given login page
and then allows you to link the various FORM INPUT fields with the appropriate
data-fields on the "card" for that website (e.g. username, password). The one-
click sign-in then just has to do a HTTP POST to the desired web-address with
the correct FORM data to act just like the real login page. It's simple
enough, but that seems like the real time-saver here. Not only could you have
a webapp which stores all your personal data, but it also provides a quick
launchpad to login any site you need. That just takes it a step further and
makes the webapp almost a blackbox: you don't really <em>need</em> to know what your
username and password is anymore because the webapp database knows it and can
feed it to the target website's login form for you.</p>

<p>This just seems like a really awesome idea, and I'm really tempted to just use
Clipperz natively so that I don't have to re-invent the wheel, but I'm still
just nervous about using someone else's website as a database to store all my
personal sensitive data. It's basically just a trust issue, and I don't think
I have any good reason to trust that their Javascript code will never do
anything malicious. I'd much rather control the data myself on my private
webserver. If only Clipperz was a SourceForge projectâ€¦ ;)</p>
