Switching to Airvoice Wireless: A Cheaper iPhone Cellular Plan

<time datetime="2013-03-06T19:41:47-06:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Mar 6<span>th</span>, 2013</time>
         &bull; <a rel="bookmark" href="/blog/2013/03/06/switching-to-airvoice-wireless-a-cheaper-iphone-cellular-plan/">Permalink</a>
      </p>
    
  </header>

<div class="entry-content"><p>For the past two and a half years, I&#39;ve been rocking my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_4">iPhone 4</a>.
It&#39;s held-up well over the years. My previous phone, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_3G">iPhone 3G</a>,
was pretty darn sluggish by the end of its two year tenure and I eagerly
awaited the point where I was eligible for a phone-upgrade so that I could
upgrade to the (<em>at that time</em>) brand-new iPhone 4.  I just always assumed that
was the &ldquo;<em>way it worked</em>&rdquo;: sign-up for a new two-year contract, get a
subsidized price on a nice shiny-new piece of phone-hardware, and don&#39;t really
think twice about the recurring $80+/month phone-bill.</p>

<p>But I didn&#39;t realize there were other alternatives&hellip;</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2>Mobile Network Virtual Operators (MVNOs)</h2>

<p>While reading though the back-archives of one of my <a href="/blog/2013/03/03/mr-money-mustache-from-zero-to-hero-in-one-blog-post/">new favorite finance blogs</a>,
I came across an interesting article, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/10/11/our-new-10-00-per-month-iphone-plans/">Our New $10.00 Per Month iPhone Plans</a>&rdquo;,
talking about switching to a monthly pre-paid plan and paying only $10/month
for an iPhone cellular plan.  I had heard mention of some of these &ldquo;pre-paid&rdquo;
cellular vendors before but had never really looked into them much or really
understand what they were:</p>

<blockquote><p>Many of these new options are called Mobile Network Virtual Operators (MNVOs), and they are in fact just re-selling access to the bigger carriersâ€™ networks. So you get the same reception, coverage, and reliability as you had before.</p></blockquote>

<p>I had never realized! Same cellular network/service, you&#39;re just paying a
different middle-man. And there&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_mobile_virtual_network_operators">quite a long list</a>
of these MVNO&#39;s, lots of options for each of the major US mobile operators:
AT&amp;T, Sprint, Verizon, and T-Mobile. Reading the comments in that article was
where a lot of the gold was; there&#39;s lots of great information in there. A lot
of these MVNO&#39;s have been around for quite a while and are pretty
well-established.</p>

<p>So, since my iPhone 4 hardware was still giving my reasonable performance,
I decided to skip the expected hardware-upgrade and stick with my current
handset and try to milk it for all its worth.</p>

<h2>Choosing a Company &amp; Plan</h2>

<p>After doing some more reading, I ending-up choosing <a href="http://www.airvoicewireless.com/">Airvoice Wireless</a>
because they seem to be one of the favorite (and well-established) AT&amp;T-based
MVNO&#39;s and they have <a href="http://www.airvoicewireless.com/plans-2/">lots of different plan options</a>.</p>

<p>Since my phone is <em>already</em> setup to run on AT&amp;T&#39;s GSM network, you wouldn&#39;t
even need a carrier-unlock to be able to jump to one of the AT&amp;T MVNO&#39;s because
it&#39;s still using the same carrier network behind-the-scenes.  Though, truth be
told, since I was out of my 2-year contract with AT&amp;T, I did make use of AT&amp;T&#39;s
<a href="http://www.att.com/esupport/article.jsp?sid=KB414532&amp;cv=820&amp;title=What%20are%20the%20eligibility%20requirements%20for%20unlocking%20iPhone%3F#fbid=eGlx2oAwj-R">free carrier-unlock</a>
before ditching my AT&amp;T plan so that I could use my handset when traveling
internationally should the opportunity arise&hellip;</p>

<p>I considered going the ultra-frugal <a href="http://www.airvoicewireless.com/plans-2/10-plan/">$10/month Talk &amp; Text</a>
plan but that seemed a bit too restrictive. I&#39;m coming from my AT&amp;T plan which
had 450 anytime minutes (<em>though I only used on average ~100 minutes per month
and had a huge rollover pool</em>) and my grandfathered-in Unlimited data plan from
my original iPhone 3G based plan. I usually averaged around 200MB-300MB of data
per month, so I wasn&#39;t really reaping much from my Unlimited data-plan.  The
ultra-frugal $10/month plan would mean I&#39;d <em>really</em> need to scrutinize my
cellular data usage (<em>$0.33/MB adds up quick!</em>), as in <em>turning-off</em> cellular
data most of the time and only turning it on when I absolutely needed. That was
just a bit too extreme for me &mdash; too much penny-pinching.</p>

<p>So, to make my transition from AT&amp;T to Airvoice Wireless as painless as
possible, I opted for their <a href="http://www.airvoicewireless.com/plans-2/unlimited-plans-with-data/40-unlimited-plan-with-data/">$40/month Unlimited Plan with Data</a>
which has unlimited talk &amp; text (<em>neither of which I use much of</em>) and
500MB of data per month.</p>

<h2>Making the Switch</h2>

<p>Here&#39;s a quick summary of the setup/transition process&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>Bought a Airvoice Wireless SIM card through their website. It arrived in a
few business days.</li>
<li>Activate the SIM card on Airvoice Wireless&#39;s website, picked which plan I
wanted to use, got a phone number assigned to my new account (<em>or you could
have ported your existing cell number to Airvoice</em>), and put some money into
my account.</li>
<li>Using <a href="http://amjath.com/2010/08/how-to-make-a-micro-sim-from-a-normal-sim.html">some print-out templates</a>
I found online (<em>and putting on my arts-and-crafts hat</em>), I trimmed the
normal-sized SIM card to the micro-SIM size to fit my iPhone SIM card tray.</li>
<li>Drop the new SIM card into my iPhone. No need to turn-off or power-cycle.
It connected to the Airvoice Wireless network immediately. You&#39;ll notice
the <code>AIRVOICE WIRELESS</code> vendor banner on the upper-left of your iPhone screen.</li>
<li>To get cellular data working, you need to install the correct Access Point
Name (APN) settings for Airvoice Wireless. Just connect to Wi-Fi, fire-up
Mobile Safari on your iPhone, navigate to <a href="http://www.unlockit.co.nz/">http://www.unlockit.co.nz/</a>,
select &ldquo;Airvoice&rdquo;, and click Install. It will prompt you to install a new
Profile with the APN settings for Airvoice. With the correct APN settings
in-place, I turned off Wi-Fi and the 3G data worked as normal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Easy-peasy.</p>

<h2>Initial Observations</h2>

<p>It&#39;s only been a few weeks so far, but all-in-all the transition has
been extremely painless.</p>

<h3>Pro&#39;s:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>I cut my phone-bill in <u>half</u></strong>: $85/month -&gt; $40/month. Yowza!</li>
<li><strong>Same cellular service</strong>, since I&#39;m still effectively using AT&amp;T&#39;s network.</li>
<li><strong>Not locked into another contract.</strong> I can switch to another vendor whenever
I want, if for some reason I don&#39;t like Airvoice. That kind of agility is
refreshing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Con&#39;s:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>No integrated iPhone visual voicemail</strong>, at least that I know of.  (<em>Though
this doesn&#39;t bother me much because I ported my number to Google Voice as
part of this transition, but that&#39;s a story for another time&hellip;</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Need to remember to login every 30 days to renew your service.</strong> This could
admittedly be a bit of a drag, but it&#39;s easy to add a monthly reminder, and a
few extra minutes worth of work per month seems well worth the savings of
$40/month x 12 months = ~$500/year.</li>
<li><strong>No fancy website.</strong> AT&amp;T had a pretty decent website with all kinds of
historical usage statistics. I get none of that now. Airvoice is a smaller
operation and I&#39;m okay with that. If I want to get usage stats, I just need
to do it myself using the usage-counters on my iPhone.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even if some months I do happen to go over my 500MB/month cap, I would simply
drop another $40 in my account early and that would restart the 30 day
expiration over again.  As I understand it, a given prepayment expires either:
after 30 days or after you&#39;ve used up your quota, whichever comes first.</p>

<p>If I find the $40/month plan is either too limiting or I&#39;m consistently not
using everything I&#39;m paying for, I can always easily switch to a different
plan/tier. Based on the Airvoice Wireless <a href="http://www.airvoicewireless.com/TermsOfServiceAll.aspx">terms of service</a>,
it sounds like they won&#39;t refund you a partial-month at all; you need to make a
cut at the end of your 30 day cycle (to make the most of your money) and you
need to call customer-service to switch your account over to the new plan. I
(obviously) haven&#39;t tried this yet but it sounds pretty painless.</p>

<p>And by saving <strong>$500/year</strong> on my cell phone bill, that&#39;s basically the price
of a brand-new (unlocked) flagship phone. So, I could <em>still</em> upgrade my
hardware and still come-out ahead because I&#39;m not tied into an expensive
contract with one of the big cellular companies.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see how this plays-out over the next few months, to
see what happens to my service at the end of a 30-day cycle (e.g. <em>how apparent
will it be that my service has cut off and that I need to pump more money into
my account?</em>), to see how often I use up my 500MB quota before the 30 days are
up, etc. I&#39;m just darn excited to have interesting new options/alternatives.</p>
